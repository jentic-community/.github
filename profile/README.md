# 🐤 Jentic Community

Welcome to **`jentic-community`**. We are the open playground for builders, hackers, and tinkerers in the [Jentic](https://jentic.com) ecosystem.  
Here is where we share **examples, hackathon projects, and community-driven experiments** built with Jentic’s tools.

If the main [`jentic`](https://github.com/jentic) organization is our **library of official releases**, then `jentic-community` is our **workshop**. Here is messy, creative, and full of ideas in progress.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Experiment Freely**": Build quick prototypes without worrying about production polish.
- **Share Examples**: Learn from real-world code that uses Jentic’s APIs, agents, and integrations.
- **Hackathon Home**: A place to host and showcase code from Jentic Hackathons and community events.
- **Collaborate Openly**: Submit pull requests, share ideas, and contribute to the growing library of community projects.

---

## 📂 Repository Types

You’ll typically find:

| Repo Type              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Hackathon Projects** | Codebases created during official Jentic hackathons, often collaborative and experimental. |
| **Examples & Templates** | Working demos that showcase how to integrate Jentic tools into different stacks. |
| **Playground Experiments** | WIP ideas from Rod and the community, not yet “official” but open for feedback and reuse. |

---

## 📜 Contribution Guidelines

We keep it **simple and welcoming** here:

1. **Fork & PR** – Fork a repo and open a pull request when ready to share your work.
2. **Label It** – Use tags like `hackathon`, `example`, `WIP`, `experimental` so others know what to expect.
3. **Keep It Legal** – No proprietary code you don’t have the right to share.
4. **Be Kind** – Constructive feedback only; we’re here to build together.

For more details, see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (coming soon).

## 🏗️ How This Relates to the Main Jentic Org

- [`jentic`](https://github.com/jentic): Only hosts **official**, production-ready repositories.
- [`jentic-community`](https://github.com/jentic-community): Hosts **community-driven and experimental** projects.

Sometimes projects here may **graduate** to the main `jentic` org after review and polish.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Browse repos in this org to find something interesting.
2. Clone it locally:
   ```bash

3. Run it, break it, improve it — and share your updates.
